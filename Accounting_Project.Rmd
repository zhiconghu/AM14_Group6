  mutate(operating_profit = gross_profits-9580000) %>% # subtract non-production overhead costs
  mutate(profit_as_percentage_of_sales = operating_profit/sales_revenue)
```

# Question 2

By calculating and plotting the operating profits of each region, we found that the Eastcoast region has the highest operating profits, as shown by the bar chart in figure 1. The West and South regions are suffering negative operating profits. By looking at figure 2, we see that the West region has a positive gross profits, which suggests that its non-production overheads must be higher than gross profits so that it brings the operating profits to a negative number.

By breaking down the costs, we can see that the non-production overhead costs are relatively low when compared with the other cost categories, as shown by figure 2. The largest of costs still come from product direct and variable costs, followed by production overheads.

```{r}

# calculate overhead costs in 2018
overheads_by_region <- overheads %>% 
  pivot_longer(2:9,names_to = "region", values_to = "overheads") %>%

# Question 3

As shown in figure 1 and 2, both sales revenue and contribution margin are higher for Jefferey Alexander brand. The difference in sales revenue is very large, which means that Jefferey Alexander is much more competitive in market than Elements. From figure 3, we see that for different collections, there is a positive relationship between sales revenue and contribution margin, which holds true for both brands.

From figure 4, we see that Belcastel contributed the most sales revenue and contribution margin to the Jefferey Alexander brand, while Madison contributed the most to the Elements brand.

As we can see, most regions break even in between August and September but only two regions "West" and "South" did not break even. The region "International" broke even very early in the year only at April.

# Question 5

## a)

Cost absorption is an approach of allocating fixed overhead costs to each unit of a product produced in the same period when the fixed overhead cost is made. This disregards when the produced good is actually sold.

With the data provided, we only know when products are sold but has no information on when it is produced. However, we can make an assumption that the company uses made to order policy and hence the sales is made when the product is produced. Similar to above, we will split the regional overhead costs by regional sales revenue of each transaction.

```{r}
joined_by_region <- joined_by_region %>% 
  mutate(overhead_per_sales = (production_overheads+non_production_overheads)/sales_revenue)

transactions_by_brand_collection <- transactions %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  left_join(joined_by_region %>% select(region, overhead_per_sales), by = "region") %>% 
  mutate(overheads = overhead_per_sales*sales_revenue,
         total_cost = overheads+costs) %>% 
  group_by(brand,collection) %>%
  summarize(total_cost = sum(total_cost))
transactions_by_brand_collection
```

## b)

Our full cost estimations could be improved if we can know about when the products of each transactions are produced and hence allocate the fixed cost according to their production date instead of date of sales.
